# Survey form with React

This week's project was to build a survey form in React, using state.

## The problem

I started by building a good structure in React, using one component for each part of the survey (header, question 1-3, submit button and summary) I have used "useState hook" for the inputs so that when the state changes the component will update. I have also used props to pass the state arguments from the parent component to the children components. If I had more time I would have made the site into a multi-step form.
